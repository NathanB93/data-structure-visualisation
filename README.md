# data-structure-visualisation

## Overview

This project is an Android mobile application, developed in Java, with the purpose of helping aspiring developers to understand data structures. The app allows users to visualise common structures like stacks, queues and array lists, manipulating data with the standard methods of each DS. 

The tool itself is beneficial for learning DS's, however, the real value of this exercise is that it really helped me internalise these core concepts, and improve my Java skills at the same time.
