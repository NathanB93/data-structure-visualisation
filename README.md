# data-structure-visualisation

## Overview

This project is an Android mobile application, developed in Java, which assists aspiring developers in understanding common data structure's. It allows users to visualise common structures like stacks, queues and array lists. 

The tool itself is beneficial for learning DS's, however the real value of this exercise is that it really helped me internalise these core concepts, and improve my Java skills at the same time.
